/*  
What is the Big O notation for Function sortProductsByPrice of the Question 4. Explain your reason.
Answer:
O(n^2) because it is a nested loop where the time complexity of each loop is O(n),
therefore you multiply them when they are nested and get O(n^2).
For O(n^2), which is the quadratic time complexity, the algorithm increases as the input size increases.
